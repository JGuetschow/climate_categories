comment: "\n\n\nAFOLU in the SSPDb is AFOLU minus any agriculture\nrelated fossil\
  \ fuel based emissions hence is not the same as the\nWG3 AFOLU definition. Rather\
  \ AFOLU in the SSPDb is AFOLU as expected by\nMAGICC (i.e. exluding agriculture\
  \ related fossil fuel use), hence\nwe call it MAGICC AFOLU."
